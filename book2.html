    <h1>The Brothers Karamazov</h1>
    <p>The Brothers Karamazov (Russian: Братья Карамазовы, Brat'ya Karamazovy, pronounced [ˈbratʲjə kərɐˈmazəvɨ]), also
        translated as The Karamazov Brothers, is the last novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky spent
        nearly two years writing The Brothers Karamazov, which was published as a serial in The Russian Messenger from
        January 1879 to November 1880. Dostoevsky died less than four months after its publication. It has been
        acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.

        Set in 19th-century Russia, The Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel that discusses questions
        of God, free will, and morality. It has also been described as a theological drama[citation needed] dealing with
        problems of faith, doubt, and reason in the context of a modernizing Russia, with a plot that revolves around
        the subject of patricide. Dostoevsky composed much of the novel in Staraya Russa, which inspired the main
        setting</p>
