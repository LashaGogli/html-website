    <h1>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h1>
    <p>The story revolves around a portrait of Dorian Gray painted by Basil Hallward, a friend of Dorian's and an artist
        infatuated with Dorian's beauty. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton and is soon enthralled by the
        aristocrat's hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfillment are the only things worth pursuing in
        life. Newly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure
        that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a libertine life of
        varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and visually
        records every one of Dorian's sins.</p>
