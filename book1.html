    <h1>Crime and Punishment</h1>
    <p>Crime and Punishment (pre-reform Russian: Преступленіе и наказаніе; post-reform Russian: Преступление и
        наказание, tr. Prestupléniye i nakazániye, IPA: [prʲɪstʊˈplʲenʲɪje ɪ nəkɐˈzanʲɪje]) is a novel by the Russian
        author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly
        installments during 1866.[1] It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky's
        full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered
        the first great novel of his mature period of writing[2] and is often cited as one of the greatest works of
        world literature.[3][4][5][6]

        Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished
        ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and
        valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on
        to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed
        in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of 'extraordinary' men. Once the deed is done, however, he
        finds himself racked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power
        as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his
        deed.</p>
